The 
cumulative talent, experience, and sincere interest in the success of MY 
bathroom remodels couldn’t be found in my market. The money saved by 
avoiding mistakes from my inexperience along with the professional creative 
design makes me look like an expert to my family and friends. I’m happy I 
got SPACKLED”

project myself no problem. I wasn’t wrong, but I have zero experience in 
tile, plumbing, or drywall to name a few. I needed a coach! Then when it 
came to shopping and design, we became indecisive on everything and needed 
help! Spackle provided coaching through YouTube and design and shopping 
through personal communication. Being one phone call away for any question 
or next step took all our indecision away and gave us confidence that we 
needed to take on this renovation!"
